 Assignment 1
Task 1:

First i took 2 variables and used input function to collect data from the user and specified that the variables are supposed to be number by using int function, we could also use float function if we want to calculate float number but here int takes it as whole number. Then i used more variables to perform ooperation and lastly i printed the answers.

Task 2: 

First i took 2 variables and used input function to collect data from the user and used another variable to perform the Concatenation of the strings and i added a empty space by using: (' ' ),then printed the text by adding the text and the variable to get desired result.
 
 Assignment 2
 Task 1:
 
by checking if the remainder of the number taken from the user is 0, if it is 0 then the number is a even number if not the else block is executed

Task 2: 

By puttin sum=0 , the intial value is 0 then using for loop the first iterative value is 1 and last is 50 so use n-1 so i used 51 the by using sum+=1 the value moves to next iteration till 50 and the sum is printed

 Assignment 3
 Task 1:

 by calling the function and using recursion the if block is used for the factorial of 0 and 1 as it is less than 2 and the else block for every other number by taking the number from user and storing it in num variable and then the result is doing factorial then printing i had to put extra variable as num because when i tried to calculate factorial of 0 the output was showing 1 in str(num).

 Task 2:
 
 importing the math module and putting the datatype for the given, and printing it.
